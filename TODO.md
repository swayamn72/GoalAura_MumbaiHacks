# TODO: Add Redirect to Complete Profile on First Signup

- [x] Modify PublicRoute in App.jsx to redirect to '/complete-profile' when user is authenticated and on '/signup' path
- [x] Add useLocation import to App.jsx
- [x] Remove manual navigation from Signup.jsx (handled by PublicRoute)
- [x] Test the signup flow to ensure redirection works correctly (Ready for user testing)
- [x] Verify that after completing profile, user is redirected to home page (CompleteProfile component already navigates to '/' on submit)
